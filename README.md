Mechmod has both mods in it, use map game/walker in terminal to reach the level with the mech. 
For my grenade mod I used the nailgun, changed the projectile to shoot grenade launcher projectiles instead, upped the fire rate, made the detonation faster, and the arc of the grenade less extreme. 
For my second mod. I chose to mod the Walker, it now shoot railgun shots for its machine gun, and shoots bfg projectiles instead of rockets. Oh it also will never die as well.
